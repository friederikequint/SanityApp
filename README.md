# SanityApp

SanityApp is a simple iOS mood-tracking application built with Swift. It allows users to log how they’re feeling, reflect on past entries, and get a lightweight overview of their emotional wellbeing over time. 
The app is designed as a clean, extendable starting point for personal use, experimentation, or further development of wellbeing-focused mobile apps.

## What the App Does

SanityApp enables users to:
- Record daily mood entries (daily mood, stress, optional notes)
- Review previously logged moods
- Reflect on emotional patterns over time
- Use a lightweight, private self-reflection tool
- Or even download your data and analyze it

The project is intentionally kept simple so it can be easily forked, modified, and extended.
